Playing with Python quant libraries


## QuantLib and PyQL (wrapper)

- [QuantLib](https://www.quantlib.org/)
- [PyQL](https://github.com/enthought/pyql)

### QuantLib

> The QuantLib project is aimed at providing a comprehensive software framework for quantitative finance. QuantLib is a free/open-source library for modeling, trading, and risk management in real-life.

### PyQL

QuantLib has python bindings but [PyQL APIs are more Pythonic](https://www.enthought.com/pyql-and-quantlib-a-comprehensive-finance-framework/).

> This library is a new set of wrappers using Cython on top of QuantLib. It currently focuses on useful simple objects like Date, Calendar but might be extended to more complex wrappers if needed.

> Why building a new set of QuantLib wrappers for Python? The SWIG wrappers provide a very good coverage of the library but have [a number of pain points](https://github.com/enthought/pyql/blob/master/docs/source/getting_started.rst)
